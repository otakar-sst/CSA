# CSA
This is where I will be dumping all of my files and papers for Computer Science A (2016).

### What?
This repo will contain two primary folders. One folder contains my programs, the other contains all of the PLTW assignments in PDF format. PLTW assignment responses are my intellectual property, you are required to ask for permission before using any part of my property. Programs may be used with modification.

### Who?
I'm Otakar Andrysek. I'm taking this class from Mr. Doug Wilson.

### When?
Content will be uploaded throught the 2016-2017 school year.

### Where?
The class takes place at SST (The School of Science and Technology). The course orients around preparing for the AP CSA Exam.

### Why?
I believe that resources such as these should exist for every course. Throught my high school academic career I have used online assignents and resources to help me understand difficult topics. I hope that other people can use what I post here to their advantage.
