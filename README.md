A complete guide of everything you need for *(PLTW) Computer Science A (2016)*.

### Summary
###### What is this?
This repo will contain two primary folders. One folder contains my programs, the other contains all of the PLTW assignments in PDF format. PLTW assignment responses are my intellectual property, you are required to ask for permission before using any part of my property. Programs may be used with modification.
###### Who are you?
I'm Otakar Andrysek. I'm taking this class from Mr. Doug Wilson.
###### When do you upload?
Content will be uploaded throught the 2016-2017 school year.
###### Where are you taking this class?
The class takes place at SST (The School of Science and Technology). The course orients around preparing for the AP CSA Exam.
###### Why are you doing this?
I believe that resources such as these should exist for every course. Throught my high school academic career I have used online assignents and resources to help me understand difficult topics. I hope that other people can use what I post here to their advantage.

### File Organization
*Subject to change*                    
The root ( / ) directory for this repository will be divided by the 4-6 PLTW Units. Each unit contains a few sub units (X.Y). Each subunit contains a number of program folders. Each program folder should contain the PLTW document itself, the java program(s) associated with the asignment, and possibly some extra reference files.
